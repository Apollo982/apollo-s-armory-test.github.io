hi

this is more or less just me failing to teach myself armory3d

right now, all of the code is from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j58m23mlSE) tutorial, but I'm planning on making it be more than just that soon

Armory3D is available at [their website](https://armory3d.org/engine/) or [their github](https://github.com/armory3d/armory)
